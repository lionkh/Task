I created simple server on Node.js using MongoDB as database. There are some API's which are working with data required for logging in.

There are test user: 
{
'login': 'test',
password: '123'
}

Steps to install: 

git clone https://github.com/lionkh/Task.git

cd Task

npm/yarn install

start mongod.exe and mongo.exe

npm/yarn start

go to localhost:3000
